## Customizing for Your College

The platform uses a configuration file to define college-specific details. Here's how you can update it:

```javascript
/** Example
 * @email : 2023btcse002@curaj.ac.in
 * -->
 * @localPart : 2023btcse002
 * @separator : @ 
 * @domainName : curaj.ac.in
*/

export const studentEmailConfig = {
  college: {
    name: 'Your College Name',
    shortHand: 'Short Name',
  },
  localPart: {
    example: "2023BTCSE017", // enrollment ID
    regex: /^d{4}[A-Za-z]+d{3}$/,  // Regex for enrollment ID
  },
  domainName: 'yourcollege.ac.in',
  support_email: 'support@yourcollege.ac.in'
}
```
      
  1. Update the `college` and `domainName` fields to match your college.
  2. Customize the regex for student email IDs if needed.
  3. Save the file and restart the application.
